# Project Overview

This project aims to perform a sentimental analysis on tweets and classify them as positive or negative, using a variety of machine learning techniques. The models tested include BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec.

# Getting Started

To run the code in this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- The following Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - transformers (for BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM)
  - gensim (for Word2Vec)


To run the code, clone or download this repository, open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory, and run the cells.

# Data

The dataset used in this project is a collection of tweets, with labels indicating whether each tweet is positive or negative. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size, but it can be obtained from **[this URL](insert url here)**.

# Notebook Descriptions

- `bert.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for training and evaluating a BERT model on the tweet classification task.
- `roBERTa.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for training and evaluating a RoBERTa model on the tweet classification task.
- `XLNet.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for training and evaluating an XLM model on the tweet classification task.
- `TFIDF.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for training and evaluating a model using the TF-IDF feature representation on the tweet classification task.
- `word2Vec.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for training and evaluating a model using the Word2Vec feature representation on the tweet classification task.
# Conclusion

The results of the different models are compared and discussed in the notebooks. Based on these results, you can choose the most suitable model for your needs.
